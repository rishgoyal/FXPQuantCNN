`Fashion-MNIST` is a dataset of [Zalando](https://jobs.zalando.com/tech/)'s article images—consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. We intend `Fashion-MNIST` to serve as a direct **drop-in replacement** for the original [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

Here's an example how the data looks (*each class takes three-rows*):

## Why we made Fashion-MNIST

The original [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) contains a lot of handwritten digits. Members of the AI/ML/Data Science community love this dataset and use it as a benchmark to validate their algorithms. In fact, MNIST is often the first dataset researchers try. *"If it doesn't work on MNIST, it **won't work** at all"*, they said. *"Well, if it does work on MNIST, it may still fail on others."* 

### To Serious Machine Learning Researchers

Seriously, we are talking about replacing MNIST. Here are some good reasons:

- **MNIST is too easy.** Convolutional nets can achieve 99.7% on MNIST. Classic machine learning algorithms can also achieve 97% easily. Check out [our side-by-side benchmark for Fashion-MNIST vs. MNIST](http://fashion-mnist.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/), and read "[Most pairs of MNIST digits can be distinguished pretty well by just one pixel](https://gist.github.com/dgrtwo/aaef94ecc6a60cd50322c0054cc04478)."
- **MNIST is overused.** In [this April 2017 Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/goodfellow_ian/status/852591106655043584), Google Brain research scientist and deep learning expert Ian Goodfellow calls for people to move away from MNIST.
- **MNIST can not represent modern CV tasks**, as noted in [this April 2017 Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/852594987527045120), deep learning expert/Keras author François Chollet.

## Get the Data

[Many ML libraries](#loading-data-with-other-machine-learning-libraries) already include Fashion-MNIST data/API, give it a try!

You can use direct links to download the dataset. The data is stored in the **same** format as the original [MNIST data](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

| Name  | Content | Examples | Size | Link | MD5 Checksum|
| --- | --- |--- | --- |--- |--- |
| `train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz`  | training set images  | 60,000|26 MBytes | [Download](http://fashion-mnist.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz)|`8d4fb7e6c68d591d4c3dfef9ec88bf0d`|

| `t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz`  | test set images  | 10,000|4.3 MBytes | [Download](http://fashion-mnist.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz)|`bef4ecab320f06d8554ea6380940ec79`|

Alternatively, you can clone this GitHub repository; the dataset appears under `data/fashion`. This repo also contains some scripts for benchmark and visualization.
   
```bash
git clone git@github.com:zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist.git
```

### Labels
Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:

| Label | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | T-shirt/top |
| 1 | Trouser |
| 2 | Pullover |
| 3 | Dress |
| 4 | Coat |
| 5 | Sandal |
| 6 | Shirt |
| 7 | Sneaker |
| 8 | Bag |
| 9 | Ankle boot |

## Usage

### Loading data with Python (requires [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/))

Use `utils/mnist_reader` in this repo:
```python
import mnist_reader
X_train, y_train = mnist_reader.load_mnist('data/fashion', kind='train')
X_test, y_test = mnist_reader.load_mnist('data/fashion', kind='t10k')
```

### Loading data with Tensorflow
Make sure you have [downloaded the data](#get-the-data) and placed it in `data/fashion`. Otherwise, *Tensorflow will download and use the original MNIST.*

```python
from tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist import input_data
data = input_data.read_data_sets('data/fashion')

data.train.next_batch(BATCH_SIZE)
```

Note, Tensorflow supports passing in a source url to the `read_data_sets`. You may use: 
```python
data = input_data.read_data_sets('data/fashion', source_url='http://fashion-mnist.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/')
```

Also, an official Tensorflow tutorial of using `tf.keras`, a high-level API to train Fashion-MNIST [can be found here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_classification).

### Loading data with other machine learning libraries 
To date, the following libraries have included `Fashion-MNIST` as a built-in dataset. Therefore, you don't need to download `Fashion-MNIST` by yourself. Just follow their API and you are ready to go.

- [deeplearn.js](https://deeplearnjs.org/demos/model-builder/)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist)
- [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/datasets.html#fashion-mnist)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/datasets/#fashion-mnist-database-of-fashion-articles)
- [Edward](http://edwardlib.org/api/observations/fashion_mnist)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets/fashion_mnist)
- [Torch](https://github.com/mingloo/fashion-mnist)
- [JuliaML](https://github.com/JuliaML/MLDatasets.jl)
- [Chainer](https://docs.chainer.org/en/stable/reference/generated/chainer.datasets.get_fashion_mnist.html)

You are welcome to make pull requests to other open-source machine learning packages, improving their support to `Fashion-MNIST` dataset.

### Loading data with other languages

As one of the Machine Learning community's most popular datasets, MNIST has inspired people to implement loaders in many different languages. You can use these loaders with the `Fashion-MNIST` dataset as well. (Note: may require decompressing first.) To date, we haven't yet tested all of these loaders with Fashion-MNIST.
